    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is my first web page created while learning frontend development. I'm excited to share my journey with you!</p>
    
    <p>Frontend development involves creating the visual and interactive parts of a website that users see and interact with in their web browsers.</p>
    
    <h3>Technologies I'm Learning</h3>
    <p>So far, I've been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each technology plays an important role in building modern websites.</p>
    
    <p>HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling and layout, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
